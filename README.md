R_script_for_host_trans_plasticity.R: R scripts used for analyzing "data_for_host_trans_plasticity.csv". The codes include normality testing, analyses from generalized linear mixed-effects models, model selection, and survival analyses.

metadata_for_host_trans_plasticity.xlsx: metadata explaining the details of the variables used in "data_for_host_trans_plasticity.csv", which row A indicating what each variable is, row B briefly describing each variable, row C indicating the unit, and row D showing the interpretation key.        

data_for_host_trans_plasticity.csv: the data used for statistical analyses; missing values (e.g., animals died earlier before infection status can be checked) and values that are not applicable (e.g., infection status or spore number for the control treatment) are indicated as "n/a".
